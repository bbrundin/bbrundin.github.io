       <h4><strong>Similar to </strong><em>GoneWalkabout.com</em></h4>
        <p>There are plenty of travelogues on the web, I chose this site because it was made many years ago and it's basic html style is similar to what we have learned this week. Upon inspecition there is some CSS in there also. This site has many links, could use some tables and pictures and would be considered archaic in the day and age of sites like wordpress and wix that beautify a site for you.</p>
